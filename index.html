<p>
I am Diya Shah, 12 years old and in 7th grade. My favourite hobby is reading. I started reading at an early age, and with every book I read, my interest increased. My reading speed is also quite fast. Last year, in 2020, I read 515 books. My kindle is a priced possesion, and I have used it to read many books. I am known as "Reader Queen" to my siblings and "Bookworm" to friends. Many people make the assumption that I must be a 'studier' and 'smart' because I like reading, but my real interest lies in Fantasy, and sometimes Mystery.</p>
